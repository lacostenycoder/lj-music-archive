Get a good job \
one that pays all your bills \
Study real hard \
maybe you can buy a house in Beverly Hills

Get a good job \
isn't that what they told you all your life? \
Pretend to work hard \
it doesn't matter what you do as long as it pays high

CHORUS: \
But I don't wanna live my like like that \
I wanna breath in the weather \
and feel the snow in the spring \
And I don't wanna live a paper lie \
And I don't wanna die in a box.... NO!
hoo-a-woo-hoo, howah-ooah-ooh

Get a good job \
one that pays all your bills \
Ah bust your ass real hard \
because there's bills and bills and bills to pay \
and there's so many taxes

CHORUS
