#### GT Circa 1992
[Gorilla Theater](https://reverbnation.com/gorillatheater) was formed in the Spring of 1991 by founding members
Lance Jordan (Lead Vocals, Lead Guitar) and Brian Tracey (drummer),
John LaPrade (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Sam Woodworth (bass guitar). The early
days of the band were heavily influenced by 80s alternative bands like The Smiths,
The Cure, and New Order although their musical influences were as broad as the
many types of rock music which they grew up with such as more blues influenced 60s
rock as well as 70s progressive. They played many of the NYC's most notorious and
legendary venues such as CBGB's, The Bitter End and Kenny's Castaways. After a
few lineup changes the band's final incarnation was as a power trio with Jordan
and Tracey and bassist Mike Johnson who had played in another NYC indie band
Hundred Pound Head whom they shared stages with on the local scene.

They had a two year residency at The Garden Tavern on West 30th and 8th Ave. where
they honed their sound into a more rugged but polished live band. With the money they made
from their steady gigs, they financed the recording of their independent full
length album, Evolution circa 1995. The band was nearing a major label recording
deal under veteran management. However, Jordan decided to disband GT in 1996
because he decided to further his musical development through intense musical study
which led to a year long journey into studying Jazz guitar, as well as classical
Indian music (Sitar), and even African djembe (hand drum). Eventually that journey
led him to become a music producer and DJ.
