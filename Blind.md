### Grind

_Words and Music by Lance Jordan performed by Gorilla Theater Â©1994_

We're born into the world today \
without a choice or what to say \
know the power elite wants to keep us blind \
 \
but to live in the Brave New World \
you sacrifice your right to think \
while the blind forces turn the wheels of the machine \
 \
hey generation get a clue \
they're tryna lock your minds inside a tube \
if you believe the shit they sold ya \
your living is lie..... yeah \
 \
they give drugs to make us numb \
they give us sex to make us come \
to see that nothing that we know is real \
 \
give us a God and a future life \
give us a shell and a place to die \
but could you teach us a falser sense of pride? \
 \
the population's on the boom \
and world starvation's nothing new \
but to solve these problems \
what are you gonna do....  yeah? \
 \
I believed in you... \
and I still want to... \
 \
The power elite controls billions through it's ownership of \
media of mass communications... influences the thoughts, the feelings \
the actions, of virtually everybody.  Never have so many been influenced \
so much, by so few." \
 \
C'mon generation X, before we end up like T-Rex \
don't ya wanna know if there's something real \
C'mon and educate yourselves, \
and don't just buy it because it sells \
and don't you live your life like a cog in wheel \
 \
False propaganda is a noose \
there to distract you from the truth \
with all our senses shot down \
nothing we know is real... \
