### In The Flesh
_words and music by Lance Jordan performed by Gorilla Theater Â©1994_

I was born inside a chain-linked fence \
and I will die on barbed wire \
I will bore a hole to the other side \
only to find the grass is greener on the inside \
I was sizzling in the frying pan \
so I leaped out into the fire \
and this whole world is just a fishbowl \
and the sun is an electric bulb

CHORUS:\
But if we're going to heaven \
then the only way is through the body \
are we only skin and bones \
or an astral light that shines inside? \
Enjoy your flesh while you're alive \
pleasure your senses 'till you die

Well I want someone to keep on shocking \
just so I know that I'm not dreaming \
tired eyes never wonder why \
and the daily grind's designed to keep them blind \
A skillful hand chopped off our fingers \
and now a numb sensation lingers \
and this whole world is just a fishbowl \
and the sun is an electric bulb

CHORUS
