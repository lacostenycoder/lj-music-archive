This sweet player is a strat-lover's wet dream!  It features a 9.5 inch radius maple neck with medium frets and plays exceptionally well! It's been modified with DiMarzio Hum Canceling Pickups! You get classic bell tone strat sound with added output, and warmth, minus the annoying hum! These alone are worth nearly $300! They can be setup to split coils for true single coil tone. See  The body is solid alder and is  routed for full humbuckers and spaces for coil splits. It has great acoustic tone and sustain. Nice weight but not crazy heavy. Has upgraded German tuners and real bone nut cut very nicely. Miner cosmetic scuffs on the body and no back trem cover or arm. Comes with Fender gig bag. Will ship if buyer covers shipping.

### Bridge Pickup

The Tone Zone® S brings the famous performance of the Tone Zone® to a humbucking Strat® replacement pickup. We’ve built in the tremendous mid-range and bass response of the original Tone Zone®, and the same patented dual-resonance design produces great harmonics. We also took into account the likelihood of installing The Tone Zone® S in the classic slanted Strat® bridge position, warming up the higher frequencies and brightening the low notes a little. It has 4-conductor wiring for parallel humbucking and split-coil modes, and makes a great bridge position combination with the Pro Track™, The Chopper™, and Fast Track 1™.

### Middle Pickup

The Chopper™ is the louder, punchier brother of the Fast Track 1™. More power is concentrated in the mids and low end for a bigger sound with more crunch. It shares the same side-by-side coils and twin-blade construction as the Fast Track 1™, so there are no misaligned poles or string-pull problems. We originally designed it as a bridge pickup to combine with The Cruiser® and Fast Track 1™, but it’s also a good neck pickup when you’ve got a hot humbucker in the bridge position.

### Neck Pickup

If you’re a serious traditional Strat® player, you probably won’t want to know about pickups with side-by-side coils. But if you’re the player who’s up for something more modern with no 60-cycle hum, string drop-outs or sustain-killing magnet pull, we designed The Cruiser® for you. Harmonic overtones are right where you expect them to be from a “true” single-coil, and the mid-range is open and vocal-sounding. It’s hotter than the traditional single-coil, and the bass strings have a bit more chunk; this is an excellent pickup to combine with medium-output humbuckers, and it maintains its tonal identity with high-gain amps and multiple effects.
