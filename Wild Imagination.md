### Wild Imagination

_words and music by Lance Jordan performed by Gorilla Theater Â©1994_

Once, I held your heart for ransom
you didn't care, that I wasn't even handsome
I speakin' a language you can't understand because
I make it up as I go
Alone, alone at last I'm wondering
inside my mind, the hidden spots I'm fondling
I fill in the blanks with whatever pleases
and left you there stranded alone
but oh... you had a right to know

You're just a victim of my wild imagination
and cruel reality has always been just inches from my grasp
I'm just a victim of my wild imagination

I've been accused... accused of being a weirdo
instead you seemed to understand my sense of humor
I went off on one of my infamous tangents
and you came a long for the ride
well oh... you were brave to come

You're just a victim of my wild imagination
and cruel reality has always been just inches from my grasp
I'm just a victim of my wild imagination

I wanted to feel and I wanted to know
but these waves of emotions have crushed all my bones
and washed me on shores that were strange to my soul
I'm young but my head makes me old
well I wondered off in a world of my own
well you had a right to know

I'm just a victim of my wild imagination
and cruel reality has always been just inches from my grasp
I'm just a victim of my wild imagination
oh reality is always just inches from my grasp

It was a false alarm
it was a false alarm
