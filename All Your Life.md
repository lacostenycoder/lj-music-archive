### All Your Life (Winds of Candlestick Park)
_words & music by  Roy Jordan and Lance Jordan Â©1994_

Just because you're lucky now \
doesn't mean you'll be forever \
if you look in the mirror \
you can see you're tarred and feathered

But all you're life you've just been waiting \
for me to come around again

Now you're trying to fly away you can't pretend forever \
that you're floating on whirling winds \
when you haven't left the ground

But all you're life you've just been waiting \
for me to come around again

And I will never be in love again \
and I will never be in love with you again \
you know I never saw nothing more unpredictable \
than you babe and the winds of Candlestick Park

But all you're life you've just been waiting \
for me to come around again

And I will never be in love again \
and I will never be in love with you again \
you know I never saw nothing more unpredictable \
than you babe and the winds of Candlestick Park \
you babe and the winds of Candlestick Park \
you babe and the winds of Candlestick Park \
you babe and the winds of Candlestick....

We'll get back together if we're lonely
