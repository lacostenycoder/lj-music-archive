For once in your life take a stand \
someday we're gonna leave this land \
for the colors that wash away sorrow \
seen through the eyes of the poet's tomorrow

I tell you we can make it outta here \
if we're just willing to give up the fear \
sometimes you just gotta take a chance \
there's really no way to be sure in advance

But you worry to much she said \
you worry to much she said

If you believe it to be true so it is \
give up the past, forget the future, this is it \
you know you only get one chance to be young \
don't give into the ways of the world \
your song has not yet been sung

But you worry to much she said \
you worry to much she said \
about where you're gonna live \
about what you're gonna eat \
about the clothes upon your back \
about the shoes on your fee \
look birds up in the tree \
see them fly in the blue sky \
but you never wonder why \
why you never see them cry \
when they're walking around \
when there's snow on the ground \
and you've been healthy and warm \
since the day you were born

But you worry to much she said \
you worry to much she said

We've given up on the American Dream \
'cause we're a nation of a billion James Deans \
why does the freest nation in the world \
not try to understand just what freedom means? \
oh just because our fathers were poor \
didn't I hear once "Blessed are the poor"? \
haven't we learned in 40 years \
that greed is not what it's about? \
40 years of Rock-n-Roll \
what is the shouting all about?

But you worry to much she said \
you worry to much she said

Oh why don't you live you life the way you want to? \
Why don't you find something that you really wanna do? \
I wanna be your friend, I wanna hold your hand \
I wanna love you again, I wanna help you find it

But you worry to much she said\
you worry to much she said

For once in your life take a stand \
for the colors that wash away sorrow \
Someday we're gonna leave this land \
seen through the eyes of the poet's tomorrow
